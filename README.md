# Question 3
**3a**. <i> Code overview: curl -O filename URL to WÃ¼nschiers book <i>

The curl command was used to since it can download files from a remote location, like a webpage!
Additionally, I opted to use -O (vs -o) as it automatically saved case-cp.sh in my current working directory.
```
curl -O case-cp.sh https://link-springer-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-34749-8
```

```
#!/bin/bash
time=$(date +%M)
count=0
let count=count+1;

if [[ $minute -gt 0 && $minute -lt 20 ]];
then
        echo "No Chime"
elif [[ $minute -gt 20 && $minute -lt 40 ]];
then
        echo -e "\a"
elif [[ $minute -gt 40 && $minute -lt 60 ]];
